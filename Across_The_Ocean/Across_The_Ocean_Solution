//First give everyone in the story a const variable. We use const because their values will not change.
const xayah = 165;
const yago = 41;
const zuri = 223;

//next we name the function with what we are trying to solve for.
function totalTimeInMinutes(){
  let totalSeconds = xayah + yago + zuri   //to make things easier to read we use the variables or character names and add them together
  console.log(Math.floor(totalSeconds/60)) //we use math floor to round out the time and divide by 60 to convert mintues in seconds
}

totalTimeInMinutes(); //try out the function and check it in your console!
